### Evaluating model generalization using public cancer data

We collected data from the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia to predict the presence or absence of mutations in cancer genes, using LASSO logistic regression with gene expression (RNA-seq) values as predictive features.
We trained mutation status classifiers across approximately 80 cancer genes from Vogelstein et al. 2013 [@doi:10.1126/science.1235122].
Using these data, we designed experiments to evaluate generalization of our mutation status classifiers across datasets (TCGA to CCLE, and CCLE to TCGA), and across biological contexts (cancer types) within TCGA (Figure {@fig:overview}).
