### "Best" and "smallest good" model selection strategies perform comparably

![
**A.** Schematic of "best" vs. "smallest good" model comparison experiments.
**B.** Distribution of performance comparisons between "best" and "smallest good" model selection strategies, for TCGA -> CCLE generalization. Positive x-axis values indicate better performance for the "best" model, negative values indicate better performance for the "smallest good" model.
**C.** Distribution of performance comparisons between "best" and "smallest good" model selection strategies, for CCLE -> TCGA generalization.
**D.** _NF1_ mutation status prediction performance generalizing from TCGA (holdout, orange), to CCLE (green), with "best" and "smallest good" models labeled.
**E.** _PIK3CA_ mutation status prediction performance generalizing from TCGA (holdout, orange), to CCLE (green), with "best" and "smallest good" models labeled.
