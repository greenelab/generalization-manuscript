## Results

### Generalization across cancer types yields similar results to generalization across datasets

![
**A.** Distribution of performance comparisons between "best" and "smallest good" model selection strategies, for generalization across TCGA cancer types. Each point is a gene/cancer type combination; positive x-axis values indicate better performance for the "best" model and negative values indicate better performance for the "smallest good" model.
**B.** _SETD2_ mutation status prediction performance generalizing from other cancer types in TCGA (holdout, orange) to kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP, green), with "best" and "smallest good" models labeled.
**C.** _CDKN2A mutation status prediction performance generalizing from other cancer types in TCGA (holdout, orange) to low grade glioma (LGG, green), with "best" and "smallest good" models labeled.
**D.** Distributions of performance difference between CV data (same cancer types as train data) and holdout data (cancer types not represented in train data), by held-out cancer type. Each point is a gene whose mutation status classifier was used to make predictions on out-of-dataset samples in the relevant cancer type.
