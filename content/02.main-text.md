### "Best" and "smallest good" model selection strategies perform comparably

To address the question of whether more parsimonious models tend to generalize better or not, we designed two model selection schemes and compared them, for the TCGA to CCLE and CCLE to TCGA mutation prediction problems (Figure {@fig:tcga_ccle_smallest_best}A).
The "best" model selection scheme simply chooses the top-performing model/LASSO parameter on the holdout dataset from the same source as the training data, and applies it to the test data.
The intention of the "smallest good" model selection scheme is to trade off parsimony with reasonable performance on the holdout data, since simply selecting the smallest possible model (generally, the dummy regressor/mean predictor) is not likely to generalize well.
To accomplish this, we first select the top 25% of well-performing models on the holdout dataset, then choose the smallest (i.e. highest LASSO parameter) of these models to apply to the test data.
Note that in both cases, we are exclusively using the holdout data to select a model, and only using the out-of-dataset samples to evaluate generalization performance _after_ selecting a model.
