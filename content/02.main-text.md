## Discussion

Using public cancer genomics and transcriptomics data from TCGA and CCLE, we studied generalization of mutation status classifiers for a wide variety of cancer driver genes.
We designed experiments to evaluate generalization across biological contexts by holding out cancer types in TCGA, and to evaluate generalization across datasets by training models on TCGA and evaluating them on CCLE, and vice-versa.
Our results demonstrated that in general, smaller or more parsimonious models do not tend to generalize more effectively across cancer types or across datasets, and simply choosing the model that performs the best on a holdout dataset is at least as effective for selecting models that generalize.
Our data suggest that this conclusion holds in both linear models (LASSO logistic regression) and non-linear deep neural networks, although it is less clear how to define a "small" or "parsimonious" neural network model since there are many regularization techniques that one may use to control complexity and overfitting.

For generalization from CCLE to TCGA, we observed that performance was generally worse on human tumor samples from TCGA than for held-out cell lines.
This could, at least in part, be a function of sample size: the number of cell lines in CCLE is approximately an order of magnitude smaller than the number of tumor samples in TCGA (~10,000 samples in TCGA vs. ~1,500 cell lines in CCLE, although the exact number of samples used to train and evaluate our classifiers varies by gene, see Methods for further detail).
There are also plausible biological and technical explanations for the difficulty of generalizing to human tumor samples.
The CCLE data is collected and processed uniformly, as described in [@doi:10.1038/s41586-019-1186-3], while the TCGA data is processed by a uniform pipeline but collected from a wide variety of different cancer centers and sequencing platforms around the US [@doi:10.1038/ng.2764].
In addition, this result could reflect the imperfect and limited nature of cancer cell lines as a model system for human tumors, which previous studies have pointed out [@doi:10.1093/jnci/djt007; @doi:10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-2971; @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2016.06.017].
