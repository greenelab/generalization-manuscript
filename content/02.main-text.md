## Results

### Generalization across cancer types yields similar results to generalization across datasets

To evaluate generalization across biological contexts within a dataset, we trained mutation prediction classifiers on all but one cancer type in TCGA, and held out the remaining cancer type.
We performed the same "best" vs. "smallest good" analysis that was previously described, across 294 gene/holdout cancer type combinations (Figure {@fig:cancer_type_holdout}A).
We observed 127/294 gene/cancer type combinations (43.1%) that had better generalization performance with the "best" model, compared to 78/294 (26.5%) for the "smallest good" model, and the other 89 gene/cancer type combinations having the same "best" and "smallest good" model and thus no difference in performance.
This is similar to what we observed for the cross-dataset experiments, with slightly more instances where the "best" model on the holdout data also generalizes the best, but no pronounced distributional shift in either direction.

**A.** Distribution of performance comparisons between "best" and "smallest good" model selection strategies, for generalization across TCGA cancer types. Each point is a gene/cancer type combination; positive x-axis values indicate better performance for the "best" model and negative values indicate better performance for the "smallest good" model.
**B.** _SETD2_ mutation status prediction performance generalizing from other cancer types in TCGA (holdout, orange) to kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP, green), with "best" and "smallest good" models labeled.
**C.** _CDKN2A mutation status prediction performance generalizing from other cancer types in TCGA (holdout, orange) to low grade glioma (LGG, green), with "best" and "smallest good" models labeled.
**D.** Distributions of performance difference between CV data (same cancer types as train data) and holdout data (cancer types not represented in train data), by held-out cancer type. Each point is a gene whose mutation status classifier was used to make predictions on out-of-dataset samples in the relevant cancer type.
